# technologies used
## --------------------
## technologies used include javascript, monogoDB, mongoDB-Memory-Server, mongoose, express, jest, supertest, morgan, nodemon, and finally dotenv

# explination of design
## --------------------
## the design of the project is built under the CRUD and MVC guidelines. Efforts were made to parse out and group specfic functionality into its own files for futre maintenence, ease of altercation and updating, and clean DRY code.

## user can post (create), put (update or change), get (capture a specific todo item), delete and list todo items
### root path = /todos
### get path = /todos/:id
### put path = /todos/:id
### delete path = /todos/:id

### json body must include 
### {
### title: "(title as a string)",
### description: "(description as a string)",
### completed: boolean value
### }

# how to run
## --------------------
## to run the project download the file path "todo", load the required node_modules indicated by the package.json file and include your own mongoDB connection in an .env file in the root path of the project. After these steps npm run dev to start the api on port 3000 and npm run test/load to check for functionality of the api project.

# discussion of load test results
## there seems to be timeout errors when loading higher number of scenarios which indicate that improvements to the code could be made to compensate for higher loads. <br>

# other notes on API and recursion practice
## there was some difficulties understanding and coding for the prevention for the user to update a todo item without the required json parameters. Also coding for all possible letter combinations proved to be difficult and i ran out of time before final submissions, I was able to code for final sets of letter combinations (much like doing an anagram finder) but ran into errors coding for single and double combinations.
